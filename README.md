# Heimdall

In Norse mythology, Heimdall is the gatekeeper of Bifr√∂st, the rainbow road connecting Midgard, realm of the humans, to Asgard, the realm of gods.

In iOS, Heimdall serves as a gatekeeper between Security framework and the UI, offering a nice wrapper around the C APIs for encrypting, decrypting, signing and verifying messages.

Furthermore, Heimdall also helps maintain the public-private RSA key-pair in Keychain, allowing both creating as well as deleting the key pairs.

## Installation

### Subproject

As Heimdall makes use of CommonCrypto and has it wrapped in a pseudo-module, the easiest way to use Heimdall is to include the entire project (or the produced framework).

Easiest way to use Heimdall is to include the `Heimdall.xcodeproj` into your Xcode project. Then specify the `Heimdall` target as **Target Dependency**.

Finally, make sure Heimdall is listed under the **Embedded Binaries** section in Xcode

### Directly

If you have a bridging header in place, you can also simply include `Heimdall.swift` to your project and add `#import <CommonCrypto/CommonDigest.h>` to your bridging header.

## Contributing

Currently, Heimdall offers minimal functionality, pull requests and issues are all welcome, especially for the following topics:

* Security, interacting with the Keychain, making sure the results are kept securely etc.
* Tests, adding tests would also likely increase security
* Additional configurability, perhaps allowing non-permanent keys
* Error handling, currently most of the API simply returns `nil`s whenever an error occurs, this should be changed and proper error reporting should be implemented
* CocoaPods/Carthage support, perhaps some users prefer using dependencies over CocoaPods/Carthage
